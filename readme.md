# Project Management Backend

A robust backend service for managing projects, tasks, and users. Built with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, this system ensures scalability, security, and high performance. It provides RESTful APIs for project creation, task tracking, and user management with role-based access control.

---

## Features

### User Management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Team Member).
- User authentication and authorization using JWT.
- CRUD operations for user profiles.

### Project Management
- Create, update, and delete projects.
- Assign users to projects.
- Track project progress (completed vs. pending tasks).

### Task Management
- CRUD operations for tasks.
- Assign tasks to users with deadlines.
- Update task statuses (To-Do, In-Progress, Completed).

### Notifications
- Email notifications for task assignments and updates.
- Reminders for upcoming deadlines.

### Audit Logs
- Track changes to tasks and projects for accountability.

### Reports
- Generate reports on project completion rates, user performance, etc.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Caching**: Redis (for frequently accessed data)
- **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Logging**: Logback or Log4J2
- **Deployment**: Dockerized application deployed on AWS ECS or Kubernetes

---

## Spring Boot Modules Used

- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions.
- **Spring Validation**: For request validation.
- **Spring Mail**: For email notifications.
- **Spring Cache**: For enabling caching.
- **Spring Actuator**: For monitoring application health and metrics.

## API Endpoints

### User Management
- `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login` - Login and receive a JWT token.
- `GET /api/users/{id}` - Retrieve user details.

### Project Management
- `POST /api/projects` - Create a new project.
- `GET /api/projects` - Get a list of all projects.
- `PUT /api/projects/{id}` - Update project details.

### Task Management
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task.
- `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Retrieve task details.
- `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` - Update task status or details.

---

## Real-Time Features

- **WebSocket Notifications**: Real-time updates for task status changes using Spring WebSocket.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Spring Actuator for monitoring health and metrics.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Concurrency
- Used database-level locking (Optimistic/Pessimistic) to ensure safe updates to shared resources (e.g., tasks).

### Scalability
- Implemented caching for frequently accessed APIs (e.g., user details) using Redis.
- Deployed load balancers (e.g., AWS ALB) for high-traffic scenarios.

### Data Consistency
- Ensured consistency during complex updates using `@Transactional` annotation.
